A Sudoku solver in Haskell made quicker.
========================================

In the Artificial Intelligence class at Rutgers, Prof. Chung Chieh Shan made a rudimentary branch-and-bound Sudoku solver. The solver took a long time to solve medium to hard instances. 

What I did was add a simple strategy (described in the code) to the existing program. The strategy eliminates a lot of possible solutions early on, so as to make the solver quicker. 

_To Do_: Add more strategies! More cowbell!
